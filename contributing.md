## üìå Guidelines for Contribution

We welcome contributions from anyone interested in making them. These guidelines outline our policies for accepting
contributions.

- Always fork the repository to your own GitHub profile and do your work in branches within that fork. Do not push
  branches directly to the main project repository, even if you have access to do so. However, it is perfectly
  acceptable to create branches that are related to releases.

- To contribute your work, please open a Pull Request, even if you have access to push to the main. Pull Requests
  become more necessary since your work is solely done on your fork. Please use the provided template for your Pull
  Request and fill in all the necessary details.

- Please do not merge your own Pull Request. Allow it to be merged by the reviewer once the review process is complete,
  or the review has been approved. If you push new changes after the review is approved, it must be reviewed again!
  Project leads may merge their pull requests, but are highly encouraged to seek review from the community members,
  first.

- If feedback is offered, please take it seriously. We won't generally reject a pull request based on spec, and we will
  often offer feedback on why we don't think it's a good fit or what needs to be changed. Your pull request will be more
  likely to be accepted if you honor our feedback.

- Issues should only be closed by the team lead after they have been tested by a quality assurance lead, if one is
  available, or by another developer. Please do not close issues before they are tested.

- Please keep in mind the following important points:

  - This is an open-source project run by volunteers.
  - You are welcome to fork the project or work with it under the terms of the [license][license]

  Feel free to use the code, fork the project, or make any modifications you like, especially if we are unable to
  incorporate your recommendations. However, we kindly ask you to respect our [license][license] agreement.

## ü™ù Pull Requests

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> All code that you contribute is subject to the repository's license. By submitting your code, you agree to release it
> under that [license][license].

We only accept contributions through Pull Requests on GitHub to the relevant repository/branch.

- Please document any behavioral changes in the pull request so we can easily update the [changelog.md][changelog]
  when releasing a new version.

- Please keep your commit message's first line within 80 characters. Use subsequent lines for additional information.

- Pull requests should consist of 10 or fewer files and about 500 lines of code. If your submission exceeds these
  limits, you will need to provide an explanation, and we may ask you to divide the request into logical components.

- We encourage you (though it is not required) to write tests for your contributions. We understand that unit testing
  can be challenging. If you have written tests for your code, we strongly encourage you to run those tests before
  submitting a pull request.

- If your changes break backward compatibility with the current stable version, they must be included in the next major
  version release. Please submit your Pull Request targeting the branch for the upcoming major version. If a branch for
  that version has not yet been created, please request that one be set up for you. Additionally, any breaking changes
  should include a migration guide to assist users in transitioning from the old version(s) to the new version.
  We cannot accept changes that break backward compatibility in the current version, as this would violate Semantic
  Versioning principles.

- All code contributed to the project is subject to the project's license. By committing and merging your code with
  ours, you agree to license your code to us under the project's license. For more details, please see the
  [Contributor License Agreement][contributor_license_agreement].

## üìç Miscellaneous

The terms of this contribution agreement may change at any time and will be published on GitHub for public access.
Changes take effect immediately for new contributions and will also apply to existing contributions. If you wish to opt
out of the new terms, please contact any member of the leadership team.
